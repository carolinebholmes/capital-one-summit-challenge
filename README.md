# Capital One Summit For Software Engineers Challenge

My winning work for the Capital One Summit for Software Engineers coding challenge, part 2 of their application for their Summit for Software Engineers.

The solution was written in Java with minimal optimizations done to improve speed. 

The challenge is described in the following:

>On February 22nd 2015, 36.6 million people tuned into the 87th Annual Academy Awards, or The Oscars. The Oscars is the oldest entertainment award ceremony and honors cinematic achievements in film.

>We’re curious whether you can use publicly available data from Twitter to understand the public’s sentiment toward the nominees, uncover trends in film popularity, and predict the award winners. We collected data on tweets using the hashtag #Oscars2015 between 5:30PM PST and 9:30PM on the day of the ceremony.

>Using the dataset found here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/mindsumo/public/oscar_tweets.csv+(1).zip) and the programming language of your choice, submit the following:

>1. Popularity Rank: A list of the most tweeted about best picture nominees (ranked from 1-8) 
2. Winner Announcement Prediction: Hour and minute when the winner (Birdman) was mentioned on Twitter most frequently 
3. Location: A list of which states were the most active in tweeting about #Oscars2015 (rank ordered from most active to least)

>Optional: 
Visualize the data trends. (e.g. Create a simple web or mobile app that displays the data points listed above and any other interesting trends you identify.)

>Criteria: 
Your application will be judged on its efficiency, clarity, and style.
